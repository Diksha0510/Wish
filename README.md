## Wish
AI powered mobile application to aid pregnant ladies

#Project Idea :

Wish is a mobile application for pregnant ladies staying alone or without any help. It gets activated by some trigger words when a lady’s water breaks and they need an ambulance or needs to inform their relative/friend of the same. It uses speech recognition and Deep Learning to get triggered by some targeted words and a third party message delivery system to perform emergency action.

#Problem Statement :

The problem we are dealing with is that in this age and day where people have started living in close-knit families, it becomes very difficult to get medical assistance in dire times. Women who are living alone in big cities, away from their families, for work or other purposes need someone to provide assistance to take them to the hospital during pregnancy emergencies, especially during their last trimester.

#Solution :

I propose to create a mobile application which will be powered by speech recognition. The application will have a GUI where it will ask and store the details of three family members who should be informed during emergencies and the name and number of nearby hospital or the hospital the patient wishes to be taken to, it will also ask for the details of the gynecologist the patient consults to be informed of the same. The Deep Learning algorithm will be triggered by stress words such as “Labor Pain” or “My water broke” or “I need an ambulance” and will automatically send SMS on the relative/friend’s phone and call the preferred hospital for an ambulance, will also provide the option for calling the doctor. The application will need permission to make phone calls.

#Technology to be Used:

Python will be used for backend and Flutter for mobile application development. Python has all the necessary libraries for implementing speech recognition and AI. And, Flutter can be used to develop applications for both iOS and Android, therefore caters to a wider audience. A third party application API will be connected to send SMS.

#Timeline:

Create the UI - 1 week
Identify a database and train the model - 3-4 weeks
Create mobile application - 3-4 weeks
Connect the application to the model (work on the backend) - 2-3 weeks
Test the application - 1 week
